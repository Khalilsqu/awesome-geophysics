# History of Awesome Repositories

The `awesome` movement started in 2014 when [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) created the original [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) repository. His goal was to curate high-quality resources across various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. The project quickly gained popularity, inspiring numerous domain-specific `awesome` lists covering topics from artificial intelligence to security and physics.

Over time, contributors expanded the concept, maintaining strict quality control and ensuring that the lists remained useful, well-structured, and community-driven. The core principle behind the `awesome` ecosystem remains the same: providing developers and researchers with a trusted, curated list of the best resources available.

As the movement grew, so did its guidelines, ensuring that only truly exceptional projects were included. Today, the `awesome` repository ecosystem continues to thrive, serving as a valuable resource for developers, researchers, and learners worldwide.

# Our Definition of Awesome

If you want a project to be included in this `awesome` list, please check our definition of awesome. After all, it's a curation, not a collection. We base it loosely on the [manifesto of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html). We say loosely, because their standards are higher. Our definition of awesome is more like guidelines to aim for and less like a strict set of rules. If you're new to coding and aren't sure if something qualifies, submit a pull request following the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md) and maintainers will help you out!

For now, we choose English as a common language for the list and as acceptable contributions to the list.

But **what is awesome?**

# Datasets

Awesome datasets need an open license and should be accessible. Ideally, they should be obtainable online, without sign-up.

## Dataset Documentation

Awesome datasets contain a full description of the data included and information about acquisition, processing, and reference implementations of loading and visualization.

## Download Instructions

Awesome datasets make it easy to obtain the data. Tell the community how they can best obtain the data in the most stable way.

# Software

Awesome software is easy to install, beautifully documented with great examples, and fully tested to ensure functionality. We go into more detail in the following sections.

## Software Documentation

For a project to be awesome, documentation should be awesome.

### Readme
The readme of the repository should be well formatted and contain the gist of the project, linking all the following points.

### Installation Instructions

Awesome software makes it easy to use and include in your programming environment.

### Examples and Tutorials

An awesome project includes tutorials and examples on how to use the software.

### API Documentation

The API should be described in the documentation with example inputs and outputs.

## Software Tests

> Untested code is broken code.

Awesome projects make sure their code is working, ideally through automated tests.
