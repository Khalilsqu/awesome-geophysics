  - **`ffmpeg`** – Convert geophysical images and animations into videos.  
  - **`rsync` & `scp`** – Transfer large datasets efficiently across remote servers.

- **Example:** Automating seismic file renaming  
  ```bash
  # Rename all .sgy files to include date
  for file in *.sgy; do
      mv "$file" "$(date +%Y%m%d)_$file"
  done
  ```
